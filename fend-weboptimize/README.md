## Website Performance Optimization - Portfolio project

The website included is part of a Browser and Website Performance optimization project in which the original set documents were under-performing and under-optimized in PageSpeed (see [here](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/)), and FPSs (see [here](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/?hl=en)). In the course of this project, a varied amount of changes were made to the production line code in order to optimize the performance of said pages to meet a minimal set passing criteria. For ~index.html~, it was required that the page reached PageSpeed score of 90 for mobile, and 90 for desktop. For pizza.html, it was required that the site met met with a consistent 60 FPS during scrolling.

### FPS (Frames-Per-Second)

Optimizations for: view/js/main.js, view/styles/styles.css, view/index.html

1. Eliminated excess in updatePositions function by creating new array to capture and store niche modulus-generated variables per scroll position
2. Reduced interaction of pizza size-changer to ~1ms by eliminating excess calcuations and refactoring for-loops.
